 LOTE_BOH.1.de: "The previous Bohemian king has died of old age, and it is time to elect a new king. The four candidates are of similar age and capability, but their origins are different. Electing any ruler but a Piast would break a tradition molded by centuries, but it may be what we need to escape Polish influence. However, the Poles may try to intervene if we do so. Consider wisely."

 LOTE_BOH.2.b: "Leave the Czechs alone, they aren't worth the time."
 LOTE_BOH.3.t: "The Polish Meddle With the Election"
 LOTE_BOH.3.d: "The Polish have supported a massive uprising in the capital, claiming that their candidate is the rightful ruler of Bohemia! Such insolence will not be tolerated."

 LOTE_DAN.2.t: "Greenlandic Fishers Move West"
 LOTE_DAN.2.d: "Having travelled so far for fish, the good fishers of Greenland came upon a strange new land. They knew they had gone west, so it wasn't home; but it wasn't Greenland either. Was this the fabled "Vinland" told of in children's stories? Either way, the queen has issued a royal decree stating to map the new fishing routes and to explore this new land. This Norse exploration will not be forgotten."
 LOTE_DAN.2.a: "The Vinland saga continues..."
 LOTE_LTN.1.t: "Italianization"
 LOTE_LTN.1.d: "Italianization is a measure of how aligned to the culture of Italy or Greece Rhomania is. The scale goes from -5 to 5, with -5 being completely Greek aligned and 5 being completely Italian aligned. The variable can be changed based on events or decisions. Events will change based on whether Rhomania is aligned to Greece or Italy."
 LOTE_LTN.1.a: "Got it!"
 LOTE_LTN.2.t: "The Kingdom of Greece"
 LOTE_LTN.2.d: "The Kingdom of Rhomania has failed in its purpose to be a haven for Catholics in Greece. Our administrators are Greek, our churches are Orthodox, and our people yearn for a Greek cultural identity. With the massive Greek influence, it is safe to say that the Kingdom of Rhomania's chapter in history has come to a close, and a new one begins for a fully Greek kingdom."
 LOTE_LTN.2.a: "Long live the Kingdom of Greece!"
