 #Abbasid Missions
 #First Column
 abs_restore_caliph_legitimacy_title: "Restore Legitimacy"
 abs_restore_caliph_legitimacy_desc: "After centuries of decline, our title of Caliph has lost legitimacy in the eyes of many muslims. After strenuous reform and recovery, the title of Caliph has been restored in the eyes of many, and he can reclaim the Abbasid legacy!"
 abs_zangid_dependency_title: "Zangid Dependency"
 abs_zangid_dependency_desc: "The Zangids had been loyal vassals, until they left realm during our years of decline. It is only right to reach out and once again re-establish lordship over the Zangids."
 abs_ayyubid_support_title: "Seek Ayyubid Support"
 abs_ayyubid_support_desc: "The Ayyubids have a long history of both befriending us and rivaling our power. In the looming struggle for power between Mamluks and us, it is time for the Ayyubids to choose their sides. If the Ayyubids side with us, we will possess a clear advantage over our Mamluk adversaries."
 abs_border_mamluk_title: "Approach the Mamluks"
 abs_border_mamluk_desc: "We are now prepared to fight the Mamluks. All we need now is a common front to invade the Mamluks from. Our recent conquests in Arabia may provide the perfect opportunity for this..."
 abs_defeat_mamluk_title: "Topple the Traitors"
 abs_defeat_mamluk_desc: "During our decline in power, we had lost our control over Egypt. Egypt had gone under the rule of various nations, but has now settled down under the rule of the Mamluks, a once loyal army of non-arabs. They are now the dominant power in the region, and likely seek to claim the Caliphate for themselves. We must overthrow the traitors, and re-establish our presence in Egypt."
 #Second Column
 abs_arabian_expedition_title: "The Arabian Expedition"
 abs_arabian_expedition_desc: "Our declining power can only be remedied through the expansion of our borders. Our best mode of expansion is likely down south, in the largely divided Arab peninsula."
 abs_crossing_peninsula_title: "Crossing the Peninsula"
 abs_crossing_peninsula_desc: "With tensions with the Mamluks brewing, our access to invade the Mamluks is very restricted. The deserts of Arabia are harsh to trek, and we must occupy these lands if we wish to have an outpost against our enemies."
 abs_seize_gulf_title: "Seize the Persian Gulf"
 abs_seize_gulf_desc: "The traders of Hormuz have precedent over all trade coming into the Persian Gulf. Their strict trade policy has greatly hindered any trade recieved in our home node of Basra. We must establish our presence in the Straits of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman if we desire any trade influence in the world."
 #Third Column
 abs_religious_identity_title: "Strengthen Our Religion"
 abs_religious_identity_desc: "Our lands are plagued with deep religious divide, we must mend this divide if we wish to stand strong as a nation."
 
 #Mongol Missions 
 mongol_loot_other_tribes_title: "Loot the Steppes"
 mongol_loot_other_tribes_desc: "The Mongol tribes are known for their looting of inferior nations. Let us amass wealth through the ducats of our enemies!"
 mongol_unite_naimans_title: "Unite the Naimans"
 mongol_unite_naimans_desc: "The westernmost tribes of the Mongol steppe, the Naimans are quite unique in that they have a writing system, mostly borrowed from the Uyghur script, thereby giving them a technological edge that we don't have. Integrating them would give us technology to put us on par with the Uyghurs and Khitans."
 mongol_raise_army_title: "Mobilize the Nomads"
 mongol_raise_army_desc: "Mongolia's rest was interrupted two centuries ago by Jamukha the Great. Now it is time to follow in his footsteps and awake the sleeping giant once again. First before all things, we'll need enough horses."
 mongol_unite_mongols_title: "Unite the Inner Mongols"
 mongol_unite_mongols_desc: "The heart of Mongolia is populated by the Khereid khanate and her tributaries. The Khereids are known for their strong administration and integrating them would give us insight into these practices."
 mongol_unite_khalkhas_title: "Unite the Khalkhas"
 mongol_unite_khalkhas_desc: "The Khalkha tribes are subservient to the Khamag khanate, the most warlike band in all of Mongolia. Their techniques in battle are unlike any other, and are worth studying when we topple them."
 mongol_appease_tribes_title: "Appease the Tribes"
 mongol_appease_tribes_desc: "With Mongolia united, it is time to look inward. Jamukha's mistake was giving too much power to local governors, and therefore the empire disintegrated on his death. We want to maintain a good relationship with the local tribes, but we cannot let the Mongol state disintegrate once again."
 mongol_form_mongolia_title: "Unite Mongolia"
 mongol_form_mongolia_desc: "Mongolia is united, but divided at the same time. Before we declare ourselves a united Mongol state, we must crush any rebellions that pop up and ensure that the seperatist movements are gone for good."
 mongol_claims_tt: "Gain claims on all other Mongol tribes."
 
 
 #Navarra Missions 
 lote_nav_mad_king_title: "The Mad King"
 lote_nav_mad_king_desc: "The mad king Charles II has claimed all of France and Burgundy, which has been deemed unacceptable by most of Europe and even members of his own court. Many are pushing to get rid of him, but many also believe in a far fetched dream of a Navarrese led France. Charles deposed or not, Navarra must be led to greatness."
 lote_nav_calm_before_the_storm_title: "Calm Before the Storm"
 lote_nav_calm_before_the_storm_desc: "In order to enforce Charles's claims, a strong ally must be made in one of the nations of Europe. Taking on the French alone is suicide as we have learned, so a safety net is required for us.
 lote_nav_unfounded_claims_title: "Unfounded Claims"
 lote_nav_unfounded_claims_desc: "Our claims to the various kingdoms and duchies of France are not taken seriously by Europe. If we were a beacon of prestige similar to France itself, then perhaps the great powers and the Pope would take us more seriously."
 lote_nav_duke_of_aquitaine_title: "Duke of Aquitaine"
 lote_nav_duke_of_aquitaine_desc: "Although not claimed by Charles himself, Aquitaine is a necessary first step towards domination of France. Aquitaine has ports for our usage and would bolster our position in France proper."
 lote_nav_duke_of_champagne_title: "Duke of Champagne"
 lote_nav_duke_of_champagne_desc: "Our humiliation at the hands of the French led to the stripping of our domain in Aquitaine. We have to make up for our embarassment in Champagne by reconquering the region."
 lote_nav_duke_of_normandy_title: "Duke of Normandy"
 lote_nav_duke_of_normandy_desc: "Through his mother, Charles II inherited the Duchy of Normandy which was seized by the English during the War of the Two Peters. A humiliation, to say the least. Reconquering Normandy is a crucial step towards becoming recognized as King of France."
 lote_nav_king_of_lotharingia_title: "King of Lotharingia"
 lote_nav_king_of_lotharingia_desc: "Burgundy is our rightful domain by blood. The duke of Burgundy favored Philip the Bold, but our claim still exists and we must not be afraid to press it."
 lote_nav_king_of_france_title: "King of France"
 lote_nav_king_of_france_desc: "France has always been Navarrese territory ever since Charles's coronation. It has resisted his rule time and time again, and a campaign into the heartland will have to be done to convince them to accept our rule."
 lote_nav_purchase_of_vizcaya_title: "Purchase of Vizcaya"
 lote_nav_purchase_of_vizcaya_desc: "The province of Vizcaya holds our brothers in the Basque culture, and is held by Castile. We do not want to mess with Castile, and perhaps an agreement to pay for the province will fare better than military conquest."
 lote_nav_develop_navarra_title: "Develop Navarra"
 lote_nav_develop_navarra_desc: "Navara as it is is a hilly region dotted with villages, not suitable to raise an army with which to campaign. In order to achieve our goals, Navarra must urbanize."
 lote_nav_basque_fisheries_title: "Basque Fisheries"
 lote_nav_basque_fisheries_desc: "With the coast reclaimed, we can focus our attention towards the sea. Great amounts of fish abound in the north, where we will go to hold a monopoly on fish in the Franco-Iberian region."
 lote_nav_basque_firearms_title: "Basque Firearms"
 lote_nav_basque_firearms_desc: "With the innovation of gunpowder having spread to Europe, it behooves us to embrace this new technology and improve on it. Our military will be top notch if we implement this tech."
 lote_nav_papal_blessing_title: "A Papal Blessing"
 lote_nav_papal_blessing_desc: "The Pope never blessed us on our campaign in France, claiming we were of the devil. Our lack of piety was shown through this endeavor, and we must build relations with the Pope through whatever means necessary for him to approve of our claims in France."
 lote_nav_mend_relations_with_france_title: "Mend Relations With France"
 LOTE_NAV_COMPLETED_EVENT_TT: "Navarra has completed the event "The Mad King.""
 
 #Latin Empire Missions
 lote_ltn_latin_diplomacy_title: "Latin Diplomacy"
 lote_ltn_latin_diplomacy_desc: "The Kingdom of Sicily has elevated our fair Duchy of Athens to the rank of Kingdom, and with the blessing of the Pope we have the once in a lifetime opportunity to claim all of Greece for ourselves! However, mighty empires seek to ruin us. To topple the empires surrounding us, we will need a network of alliances."
 lote_ltn_conquer_epirus_title: "The Fall of Epirus"
 lote_ltn_conquer_epirus_desc: "Epirus has been a nuisance even for the first Latin Empire, constantly making outrageous claims and raiding our borders. Their claims of being the Roman Empire are far from the truth, and we must do away with them."
 lote_ltn_conquer_macedonia_title: "Turmoil in Serbia"
 lote_ltn_conquer_macedonia_desc: "Serbia is falling apart, and this presents opportunity to us. The realm of Macedonia lies on the very edge of Serbia, and certainly isn't a priority in the ongoing civil war. Seizing it will extend our empire further, bolstering our control of Greece."
 lote_ltn_knights_templar_title: "The Knights Templar"
 lote_ltn_knights_templar_desc: "The Knights Templar is currently without a base of operations, and with our crusades going deeper and deeper into heretic territory, it is necessary that a holy order be established to convert the heretics. The Knights Templar would fit this purpose well, and we should extend to them an invitation to set up holy orders."
 can_use_holy_order_tt: "Unlocks the Holy Order estate."
 lote_ltn_accepts_greek_tt: "Greek will become an accepted culture at no cost."
 lote_ltn_conquer_thrace_title: "Conquest of Thrace"
 lote_ltn_conquer_thrace_desc: "Thrace is the final obstacle in our way to dominating the Greek mainland. Ever since the Bulgarians took Constantinople, the city has been in sharp decline, and we must exploit this to our advantage. Constantinople must fall, so that the Latin Empire be restored once more!"
 lote_ltn_conquer_rhodes_title: "Islands of the Aegean"
 lote_ltn_conquer_rhodes_desc: "The Knights of Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus are all influenced by different foreign powers and present a threat to our merchants as we grow stronger. To stop their piracy, we ought to invade the islands quickly and decisively."
 lote_ltn_conquer_corfu_title: "The Fortress of Corfu"
 lote_ltn_conquer_corfu_desc: "Corfu is a great fort which has been taken by the Neapolitans. The fort is a major obstacle to enemy vessels and serves as a choke point from which we can trap our enemies. We must seize it."
 lote_ltn_justify_roman_claims_title: "Claims to Rome"
 lote_ltn_justify_roman_claims_desc: "Although we are the heir to Rome, the world doesn't see us as that yet. Roman or not, in order to ensure the Christian world sees us as the true successor to the Roman Empire, we will need to gain more international prestige."
 lote_ltn_restore_constantinople_title: "Restore Constantinople"
 lote_ltn_restore_constantinople_desc: "Constantinople is the historical seat of the Roman Empire for many centuries, and now that we own it we should make it worthy of the title again. Long has it declined, but our administration will once again make Constantinople the Pearl of the Mediterranean!"
 lote_ltn_latin_navy_title: "Latin Navy"
 lote_ltn_latin_navy_desc: "placeholder"
