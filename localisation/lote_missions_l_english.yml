 #Abbasid Missions
 #First Column
 abs_restore_caliph_legitimacy_title: "Restore Legitimacy"
 abs_restore_caliph_legitimacy_desc: "After centuries of decline, our title of Caliph has lost legitimacy in the eyes of many muslims. After strenuous reform and recovery, the title of Caliph has been restored in the eyes of many, and he can reclaim the Abbasid legacy!"
 abs_zangid_dependency_title: "Zangid Dependency"
 abs_zangid_dependency_desc: "The Zangids had been loyal vassals, until they left realm during our years of decline. It is only right to reach out and once again re-establish lordship over the Zangids."
 abs_ayyubid_support_title: "Seek Ayyubid Support"
 abs_ayyubid_support_desc: "The Ayyubids have a long history of both befriending us and rivaling our power. In the looming struggle for power between Mamluks and us, it is time for the Ayyubids to choose their sides. If the Ayyubids side with us, we will possess a clear advantage over our Mamluk adversaries."
 abs_border_mamluk_title: "Approach the Mamluks"
 abs_border_mamluk_desc: "We are now prepared to fight the Mamluks. All we need now is a common front to invade the Mamluks from. Our recent conquests in Arabia may provide the perfect opportunity for this..."
 abs_defeat_mamluk_title: "Topple the Traitors"
 abs_defeat_mamluk_desc: "During our decline in power, we had lost our control over Egypt. Egypt had gone under the rule of various nations, but has now settled down under the rule of the Mamluks, a once loyal army of non-arabs. They are now the dominant power in the region, and likely seek to claim the Caliphate for themselves. We must overthrow the traitors, and re-establish our presence in Egypt."
 #Second Column
 abs_arabian_expedition_title: "The Arabian Expedition"
 abs_arabian_expedition_desc: "Our declining power can only be remedied through the expansion of our borders. Our best mode of expansion is likely down south, in the largely divided Arab peninsula."
 abs_crossing_peninsula_title: "Crossing the Peninsula"
 abs_crossing_peninsula_desc: "With tensions with the Mamluks brewing, our access to invade the Mamluks is very restricted. The deserts of Arabia are harsh to trek, and we must occupy these lands if we wish to have an outpost against our enemies."
 abs_seize_gulf_title: "Seize the Persian Gulf"
 abs_seize_gulf_desc: "The traders of Hormuz have precedent over all trade coming into the Persian Gulf. Their strict trade policy has greatly hindered any trade recieved in our home node of Basra. We must establish our presence in the Straits of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman if we desire any trade influence in the world."
 
 #Mongol Missions 
 mongol_loot_other_tribes_title: "Loot the Steppes"
 mongol_loot_other_tribes_desc: "The Mongol tribes are known for their looting of inferior nations. Let us amass wealth through the ducats of our enemies!"
 mongol_unite_naimans_title: "Unite the Naimans"
 mongol_unite_naimans_desc: "The westernmost tribes of the Mongol steppe, the Naimans are quite unique in that they have a writing system, mostly borrowed from the Uyghur script, thereby giving them a technological edge that we don't have. Integrating them would give us technology to put us on par with the Uyghurs and Khitans."
 mongol_raise_army_title: "Mobilize the Nomads"
 mongol_raise_army_desc: "Mongolia's rest was interrupted two centuries ago by Jamukha the Great. Now it is time to follow in his footsteps and awake the sleeping giant once again. First before all things, we'll need enough horses."
 mongol_unite_mongols_title: "Unite the Inner Mongols"
 mongol_unite_mongols_desc: "The heart of Mongolia is populated by the Khereid khanate and her tributaries. The Khereids are known for their strong administration and integrating them would give us insight into these practices."
 mongol_unite_khalkhas_title: "Unite the Khalkhas"
 mongol_unite_khalkhas_desc: "The Khalkha tribes are subservient to the Khamag khanate, the most warlike band in all of Mongolia. Their techniques in battle are unlike any other, and are worth studying when we topple them."
 mongol_appease_tribes_title: "Appease the Tribes"
 mongol_appease_tribes_desc: "With Mongolia united, it is time to look inward. Jamukha's mistake was giving too much power to local governors, and therefore the empire disintegrated on his death. We want to maintain a good relationship with the local tribes, but we cannot let the Mongol state disintegrate once again."
 mongol_form_mongolia_title: "Unite Mongolia"
 mongol_form_mongolia_desc: "Mongolia is united, but divided at the same time. Before we declare ourselves a united Mongol state, we must crush any rebellions that pop up and ensure that the seperatist movements are gone for good."
 mongol_claims_tt: "Gain claims on all other Mongol tribes."
