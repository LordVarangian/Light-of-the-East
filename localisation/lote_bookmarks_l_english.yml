 LIGHT_OF_THE_EAST_DESC:0 "The year is 1380, and Islam rules the world. Wonderful innovations in culture and science are made at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, and Islamic armies wrest control over the Near East. Some examples of Islamic states in prosperity are the Ayyubid Caliphate, the Sultanate of Rum, and the declining Khwarezm Empire. Each of these has seen massive growth and development in the Islamic Golden Age, and surely only good fortune awaits them!"
