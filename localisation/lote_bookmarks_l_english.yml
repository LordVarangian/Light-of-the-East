 LIGHT_OF_THE_EAST_DESC:0 "It is the year 1380, and the states of the world have never heard of a great conquest since the Seljuk Turks. Famine runs rampant in Europe, forcing people in new directions to seek their fill. Islam is still the most prominent religion, never having had its works and people razed down by foreign invaders. Asia feels less need for a strong army, focusing all their efforts on scholarship and bureaucracy. It is a world with different advantages and different norms for sure. How will you guide your nation through it?"
