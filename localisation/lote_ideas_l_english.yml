 kwm7_desc:0 "About 200 years ago, our country had a weak army. We could have been invaded by any nomad seeking glory. But now we have grown stronger, and our army must grow stronger too. Expanding our military would serve to both improve our country's morale and strengthen our defenses."

 CUM_ideas:0 "Cuman Ideas"
 CUM_ideas_start:0 "Cuman Traditions"
 CUM_ideas_bonus:0 "Cuman Ambition"
 CUM_confederation:0 "Spirit of Confederation"
 CUM_confederation_desc:0 "For most of our history, we have existed as a confederation of tribes, individual units working toward a common goal.  Cumans, Kypchaks, Vlachs, and others set aside their differences to live, trade, and raid together.  By taking this cooperative arrangement to heart, we can more easily incorporate other peoples into our more united nation."
 CUM_loot_rus:0 "Loot the Rus"
 CUM_loot_rus_desc:0 "The Rus cities just to the west are ripe for the picking!  Over the many centuries, we have led grand raiding parties into their territories, crushing ordinary soldiers and tsars alike.  If the Rus cannot protect their holdings, they deserve to be plundered!"
 CUM_foreign_nobility:0 "Foreign Nobility"
 CUM_foreign_nobility_desc:0 "Many Cumans from border tribes have opted to reside in neighboring countries.  Some of these immigrants have joined these nations' nobility, even royalty.  By cultivating our cultural kinship with these expatriates, we can further our diplomacy with the many nations they represent."
 CUM_cavalry:0 "Ride or Die"
 CUM_cavalry_desc:0 "Few abilities matter more to a Cuman than skill with a horse.  Whether hunting for food or men, we who live on the Eurasian steppes live or die on horseback.  Our more 'civilized' neighbors are ill-prepared to face the cavalry of true steppe warriors!"
 CUM_crimea_trade:0 "Transoxiana to Italy"
 CUM_crimea_trade_desc:0 "Our trade in Crimea brings goods from far and wide, from within and outside our confederation.  Traders from Italy to central Asia exchange furs, clothing, and even slaves; many of Egypt's mighty Mamluks originated in our lands.  By leveraging our powerful presence in this area's trade, we can ensure our traders always find business across multiple continents."
 CUM_discipline:0 "Mighty Warriors"
 CUM_discipline_desc:0 "Cuman warriors have proven themselves time and again.  Many times have we annihilated the lesser forces of the Rus; under Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan, our kinsmen decisively destroyed an army of the Latin pretenders.  Our warriors are the fiercest the steppes can offer, and our enemies underestimate us at their peril!"
 CUM_codex_cumanicus:0 "Adapt the Codex Cumanicus"
 CUM_codex_cumanicus_desc:0 "Around a century ago, missionaries of Roman Christianity began writing the Codex Cumanicus, a manual designed to help them communicate with our people.  Of particular note, the Codex contains Christian verses written in Cuman.  Whether or not we choose to adopt their ways, we should adopt their tactics and use our written language to spread our beliefs across our domain."

 QCH_ideas_start:0 "Qocho Traditions"

 QCH_legitimacy:0 "Heirs of the Khaganate"
 QCH_legitimacy_desc:0 "The Uyghur Khaganate may have long ceased to exist, but its people live on in our society.  With the fall of Khotan several centuries ago, we are the true heirs of the Khaganate."
 QCH_administrators:0 "Able Administrators"
 QCH_administrators_desc:0 "To the many illiterate tribes of the steppes, our people are considered among the best administrators out of China itself.  We should leverage our abilities to further increase the efficiency of our administration."
 QCH_many_religions:0 "One People, Many Religions"
 QCH_many_religions_desc:0 "Our society is mainly Buddhist, but many Uyghurs openly practice other religions, such as Manichaeism and Nestorian Christianity.  Their spiritual choices do not make them lesser members of our nation."

 QCH_public_aid_desc:0 "The Song considered us a land without poverty.  We give public aid to those who are starving, and as a result our people live long, healthy lives.  By expanding our public aid programs, we can help our newer citizens feel the benefits of joining our nation."
 QCH_cav_traditions:0 "Equestrian Traditions"
 QCH_cav_traditions_desc:0 "Our people may have forgotten our position on the steppes, but they have remembered the critical role our horses played in our survival.

 QCH_assimilation:0 "Uyghur Assimilation"
 QCH_assimilation_desc:0 "Few remember the Tocharians; we assimilated them after we migrated to the Tarim Basin.  The Sogdians too have willingly joined our way of life.  By understanding how we have assimilated the native Iranian and Turkic peoples of the Tarim Basin, we can ensure other peoples see our way of thinking quickly and efficiently."
 QCH_tunnel_builders:0 "Tunnel Builders"
 QCH_tunnel_builders_desc:0 "We carved the Bezeklik Caves out of the Earth, impressive structures housing magnificent Buddhist murals.  Perhaps we could learn something from these constructions that would apply above ground as well?"
 
 SIE_ideas: "Sienese Ideas"
 SIE_ideas_start: "Sienese Traditions"
 SIE_ideas_bonus: "Sienese Ambition"
 constitution_of_1179: "Constitution of 1179"
 constitution_of_1179_desc: "Our constitution that upholds the Sienese Republic is vital to our survival and is an important part of the history of Siena as a whole. By reforming it as time goes on and keeping up with new administrative practices, the republic itself will never die out."
 remember_the_battle_of_montaperti: "The Battle of Montaperti"
 remember_the_battle_of_montaperti_desc: "On the 4th of September, 1260AD, the army of the Republic of Siena defeated the Florentines in a battle that, on paper, should have been won by the Florentines since they outnumbered the Sienese (~20,000 vs. ~33,000). Our miraculous victory over the devilish Florentines is something to be heralded for ages to come, as a badge and title of honor for the republic and a memory by which our military strives to uphold and honor throughout the generations."
 reform_monetary_practices: "Reform Monetary Practices"
 reform_monetary_practices_desc: "Our skills in handling money is no secret. Since our inception in the early 12th century, money handling has been key to how Siena thrives and prospers, thus making us ripe for financial collapses or mishaps. By reforming how we do such monetary transactions and deals, whether they are in the form of taxes or loans, we can ensure a great income and financial stability for the whole of Siena."
 alliances_and_rivals_of_italy: "Alliances and Rivalries in Italy"
 alliances_and_rivals_of_italy_desc: "The many powers in Italy know that alliances, marriages, and rivals all play a role in the constant power struggles that occur. It is no secret that all Italian states, no matter how small, wish for a more unified homeland, but that will only occur via bloodshed and unrepentant deals, so we must be the same and do what we can to ensure we are diplomatically on top."
 stave_off_episcopal_dominance: "Stave of Episcopal Dominance"
 stave_off_episcopal_dominance_desc: "The Papacy is a fine figure in Italy, contentious as it may be with the Papal States attempting to secure political authority on top of religious authority. Still, despite our proclamation as an independent republic, they seek to slowly bring the tide of episcopal dominance over us, over Siena as a whole. We must not allow this to happen, no matter the cost; the Republic of Siena must survive!"
 secure_italy_against_tuscans: "Against the Tuscans"
 secure_italy_against_tuscans_desc: "The Tuscans of Italy have always been our rivals and they know this all too well, like we do. We must do what we must to keep our administration clean of schemeing Tuscan merchants, diplomats, and agents so that we can proceed unhindered against them, politically and militarily."
 produce_grand_art: "Produce Grand Art"
 produce_grand_art_desc: "The crown jewel of the republic has to be the blooming industry of fine art. Magnificent paintings and painters produce works of unimaginable grandeur for the likes of royalty, nobility, and the clergy alike and when they make their rounds outside of Siena, they only bring our name further out to different realms, and our prestige, higher than ever before. Who wouldn't want a Sienese art piece, after all?"
 
 QRA_ideas: "Kara-Khitan Ideas"
 QRA_ideas_start: "Kara-Khitan Traditions"
 QRA_ideas_bonus: "Kara-Khitan Ambition"
 QRA_a_new_homeland: "A New Homeland"
 QRA_a_new_homeland_desc: "After the Jurchens forced us from our ancestral home, our founder Yelü Dashi fled west to establish a new nation.  In a matter of decades, we established a new empire through conquest.  Who says we should stop now?"
 QRA_muslim_subjects: "Muslim Subjects"
 QRA_muslim_subjects_desc: "Most of our subjects are Muslim, but we do not let this difference distract from their status as loyal subjects.  We have permitted our Muslim citizens to worship freely with no interference with local religious authority.  Were we to adapt this policy to other religions, our new subjects could continue their old methods of worship so long as they swear loyalty to our nation."
 QRA_liao_legacy: "Liao Legacy"
 QRA_liao_legacy_desc: "Our nation was born from the Khitan Liao dynasty that ruled an empire across the steppes of northern China and Mongolia.  The Jurchens may have sent the Liao west, but they could not extinguish us.  Reminding our subjects of their leaders' heritage would go a long way in legitimizing our rule."
 QRA_nation_of_vassals: "A Nation of Vassals"
 QRA_nation_of_vassals_desc: "At its height, our nation commanded the respect of numerous vassals, from the Kwarezmids in Persia to the Uighurs of Qocho in the Tarim Basin.  Unfortunately, many of our former subjects forgot where their loyalties should lie.  We should refine our administration so that future vassals understand that their prosperity depends on their loyalty to us."
 QRA_khitans_and_karluks: "Khitans and Karluks"
 QRA_khitans_and_karluks_desc: "While most of our population lives a sendentary lifestyle, our founders, the Khitans, remain a nomadic people.  The Karluks remain nomads as well, and our mutual lifestyles make us brothers in arms from horseback.  At the dawn of our nation, Yelü Dashi led tens of thousands of Khitans and Karluks to a great victory at Qatwan against the Kara-Khanids and their Seljuk overlords.  Encourging our nomadic peoples to remain ready to fight from horseback would go a long way in ensuring military supremacy on the Central Asian steppes."
 QRA_karakhanid_tax_collectors: "Kara-Khanid Tax Collectors"
 QRA_karakhanid_tax_collectors_desc: "Why slaughter or expel your former enemies when they could serve your administration?  After our successful early conquests, we allowed Kara-Khanids to remain in our empire as tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar.  Continuing this pragmatic approach with future conquests would ease administrative burdens and keep our government well funded from new subjects."
 QRA_salaried_soldiers: "Salaried Soldiers"
 QRA_salaried_soldiers_desc: "Who fights well on an empty stomach?  Unlike our neighbors, we pay our great warriors a salary for their service.  We should continue this practice to keep our soldiers well motivated and ready for battle."
