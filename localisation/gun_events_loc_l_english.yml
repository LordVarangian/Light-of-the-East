 gun_events.1.t: "Portuguese Missionaries in the Canaries"
 gun_events.1.d: "More white men have shown up on our shores, but their purpose doesn't seem to be trade. They claim to be spreading the word of someone named "Deus". Even some of our men believe in this "Deus". We already have a faith, but they seem unfaltering about wanting us to convert to their God."
 gun_events.1.a: "Succumb to the pressure and convert to their faith."
 gun_events.1.b: "Allow them to spread their faith but keep a close eye on them."
 gun_events.1.c: "Force them to leave. They mustn't infringe on our beliefs."
 gun_events.2.t: "Conversion of the Guanches"
 gun_events.2.d: "The Guanches of the Canary islands seem to have embraced the efforts of our missionaries in the area. Their chief has fully converted to Catholicism and is now encouraging his subjects to do the same. Such piety should be rewarded, no?"
 gun_events.2.a: "Great news! Issue a declaration of protection for them."
 gun_events.2.b: "So what? It is simply the Lord's work."
 gun_events.3.t: "A Christian's Duty"
 gun_events.3.d: ""It is the duty of every pious man," continued the Castilian priest, "to enforce God's will against the infidel." The Castilians had come not for trade nor to evangelize, but to make a proposal. They claim that our participation in a crusade against the Moors would prove we are of the Catholic faith. They promise us the port of Ifni if we participate, as well as our eternal salvation."
 gun_events.3.a: "This is our chance to prove our faith!"
 gun_events.3.b: "Surely this is unnecessary!"
 gun_events.4.t: "The Guanches Refuse to Fight"
 gun_events.4.d: "The Guanches have refused their one opportunity to prove they are true Catholics by not participating in the Moorish Crusade. Such acts of blasphemy are why Catholicism is in decline. Their help is unneeded, but the king is considering whether to persuade them more aggresively to join us."
 gun_events.4.a: "If they will not be our knight, they will be our pawn."
 gun_events.4.b: "Leave them in the dark, they won't be competing with anyone anytime soon."
 gun_events.5.t: "A Promise Fulfilled"
 gun_events.5.d: "The Castilians promised us the port of Ifni in exchange for our assistance in the crusade against the Moors and they have delivered. The port belongs to us now, and our connections with Castile have grown closer."
 gun_events.5.a: "Wonderful!"
 gun_events.6.t: "A Western Education?"
 gun_events.6.d: "The King of Portugal has made an offer to allow our heir a western education in the Portuguese court, for a small price. This would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform this loose confederation of tribes into a kingdom like the ones in Europe! Though some would argue that the old ways are better, and that the ways of Europe would corrupt our traditions. The king is deep in thought."
 gun_events.6.a: "Send the kid to Portugal and teach him all there is to know!"
 gun_events.6.b: "Why change the status quo when we are doing just fine?"
 gun_events.7.t: "Western Education Pays Off"
 gun_events.7.d: "Our heir has returned upon hearing of the death of the old chief, and his first action is to reform the Canary Islands into a monarchy. He has reformed almost every aspect of society, laying the groundwork for a new Guanche identity. We are no longer a loose confederation of tribes, but the Kingdom of the Canaries!"
 gun_events.7.a: "Time to build a new country."
 gun_events.9.t: "The Conversion of the Guanches"
 gun_events.9.d: "We had previously allowed the King of Portugal to stay and spread the word of 'Deus', it appears they have managed to gain significant interest of our population! There may be a chance that these white men may convert the majority of our people to 'Deus'!"
 gun_events.9.a: "Only time can tell what will occur."
 gun_events.10.t: "Portuguese Meddling in the Canaries"
 gun_events.10.d: "It appears that the Portuguese sent missionaries to the Canary islands! Not only did they stay, but it appears they may have convinced a handful of locals to follow the teachings of Jesus! Thanks to this they have a more firm grasp on the islands than we do! We must take charge of the situation and handle this, less we allow the Portuguese to gain more control in the region!"
 gun_events.10.a: "Prepare for war!"
 gun_events.10.b: "Prepare for war!"
 gun_events.10.c: "Hmm, perhaps there may be another option."
